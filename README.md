# Function Plotter

## Overview

The Function Plotter is a web application designed for plotting mathematical functions interactively. Users can input the function they want to plot, specify the range of x and y values, choose a color for the plot, and visualize the function graphically. The application utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and the function-plot library to provide a user-friendly interface for plotting mathematical functions.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to input function parameters and visualize the plotted function.

- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience across various devices and screen sizes.
